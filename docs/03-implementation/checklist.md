## üö® Critical Path Items

These items block other work and must be completed first:

1. **Module Federation Migration** (Week 1)
   - Blocks: All subsequent architecture work
   - Risk: High complexity
   - Mitigation: Incremental migration, feature flags

2. **Authentication System** (Week 5)
   - Blocks: RBAC, secure features
   - Risk: Integration complexity
   - Mitigation: Use proven auth provider

3. **CI/CD Pipeline** (Week 11)
   - Blocks: Automated deployments
   - Risk: Environment configuration
   - Mitigation: Start with simple workflow
