# Security Audit Summary

**Status**: ✅ **SAFE FOR PRODUCTION**  
**Last Audit**: October 19, 2025  
**Total Vulnerabilities**: 41 (5 low, 24 moderate, 12 high)

## Quick Assessment

### ✅ Production Impact: ZERO

All 41 vulnerabilities are in **development/build dependencies only**:
- Angular SSR packages (not using SSR)
- Build tools (esbuild, vite, webpack-dev-server)
- Deployment tools (Vercel CLI, Lerna)
- Development compilers (Vue template compiler)

**None affect production runtime code.**

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check for high/critical vulnerabilities
npm run audit:check

# Apply safe (non-breaking) fixes
npm run audit:fix

# Generate detailed JSON report
npm run audit:report

# View full assessment
type docs\07-reference\security-vulnerabilities.md
```

## Key Points

1. **Zero Production Risk** - All issues in dev/build tools
2. **Angular SSR Vulnerability** - Not applicable (we don't use SSR)
3. **Dev Server Issues** - Only affect local development
4. **Breaking Changes Required** - All fixes need major version upgrades

## Recommendation

✅ **Proceed with current setup** - All vulnerabilities are in controlled development/build environments.

📋 **Monitor regularly** - Run `npm run audit:check` weekly.

🔄 **Plan upgrades** - Address during major version migrations (Phase 2+).

⚠️ **DO NOT run** `npm audit fix --force` - Will break Angular, Vercel, and other tools.

## Next Steps

- Continue development with current dependencies
- Review `docs/07-reference/security-vulnerabilities.md` for detailed analysis
- Schedule major upgrades for Q2-Q3 2026 during planned refactoring
