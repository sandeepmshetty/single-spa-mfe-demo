## 💰 Total Cost of Ownership (3 Years)

### **Premium Free Tier**
```
Service costs:           $0/month  × 36 months = $0
Setup time:              1 hour    × $0/hour   = $0
Maintenance:             0 hours   × $0/hour   = $0
Infrastructure:          $0/month  × 36 months = $0
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total 3-Year TCO:                                $0
```

### **Open Source Stack**
```
Service costs:           $0/month  × 36 months = $0
Setup time:              6 hours   × $0/hour   = $0
Maintenance:             3 hrs/wk  × $0/hour   = $0
Infrastructure:          $0/month  × 36 months = $0  
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total 3-Year TCO:                                $0
```

**But**: Open source requires 468 hours of maintenance over 3 years!
