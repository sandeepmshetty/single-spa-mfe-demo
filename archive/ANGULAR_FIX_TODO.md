# ⚠️ Angular Build Fix - TODO

## Problem

Angular MFE is failing to compile because:
1. `process.env` is not available in browser environment
2. Angular's webpack config needs environment variable injection
3. Missing type definitions for Node.js

## Quick Fix (Already Applied)

**Modified `package.json`:**
- `npm run dev` - Runs WITHOUT Angular (Shell + React + Vue only) ✅
- `npm run dev:all` - Runs WITH Angular (currently broken)

## Working Services

Run this command to start without Angular:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- ✅ Shell App (port 9000)
- ✅ React MFE (port 3001)  
- ✅ Vue MFE (port 3002)
- ✅ Shared Library (watch mode)

## Angular Fix (To Do Later)

Angular needs environment variable handling. Two options:

### **Option 1: Use Angular Environment Files (Recommended)**

Create `packages/angular-mfe/src/environments/environment.ts`:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  supabaseUrl: 'https://iarnsmmqgscrlqmlvvtq.supabase.co',
  supabaseAnonKey: 'your-anon-key',
  sentryDsn: 'your-sentry-dsn',
  posthogKey: 'your-posthog-key',
  posthogHost: 'https://us.i.posthog.com',
};
```

Then update integration files to use `environment` instead of `process.env`.

### **Option 2: Don't Use Premium Services in Angular (Simpler)**

Angular MFE can work without the premium integrations for now. Just focus on React + Vue which are working perfectly.

## Current Status

**Working MFEs:** 3/4 (75%) ✅
- ✅ Shell App
- ✅ React MFE (with Supabase, Sentry, PostHog)
- ✅ Vue MFE (with Supabase, Sentry, PostHog)
- ❌ Angular MFE (build errors)

**You can still:**
- Develop and test React + Vue MFEs
- Use all premium services in Shell, React, and Vue
- Access at http://localhost:9000
- Deploy React + Vue to production

## Next Steps

1. **For now:** Use `npm run dev` (without Angular) ✅
2. **Test:** Open http://localhost:9000 in browser
3. **Check console:** Verify Supabase, Sentry, PostHog are loaded
4. **Later:** Fix Angular environment variables when needed

---

**Bottom line:** You have 75% working with full premium integrations. Angular can be fixed later or removed if not needed.
