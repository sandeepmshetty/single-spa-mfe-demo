## 🎯 Current State

### Services Status
| Service | Integration | Testing | Dashboard |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Supabase | ✅ Complete | ✅ Verified | ✅ Accessible |
| Sentry | ✅ Complete | ✅ Verified | ⏳ Needs prod test |
| PostHog | ✅ Complete | ✅ Verified | ⏳ Needs prod test |
| Grafana | 🔧 Configured | ⏸️ Pending | - |
| Resend | 🔧 Configured | ⏸️ Pending | - |
| Cloudflare | 🔧 Configured | ⏸️ Pending | - |

### Architecture Highlights
- **Single Bundle**: All premium dependencies in shared-library.js (2.2MB)
- **Lazy Initialization**: Supabase client created on first access (Proxy pattern)
- **Environment Aware**: Dev logs to console, prod sends to services
- **Global API**: 40+ functions on `window.sharedServices`
- **Dynamic Loading**: Import map detects localhost vs production

**Use When**: First-time visitor, need quick overview

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Right Now)

### Test Everything Works
```bash
# 1. Start all services
npm run dev

# 2. Open browser: http://localhost:9000

# 3. Open console and run:
window.sharedServices.isSupabaseConfigured()  // Should return true
window.sharedServices.initSentry()
window.sharedServices.initPostHog()
window.sharedServices.trackEvent('test_from_console')
```

**Expected**: All return values, no errors ✅

---

### Start Building UI (Next Step)
```bash
# 1. Open NEXT_STEPS.md
# 2. Follow "Task 1.1: Create Login Form"
# 3. Copy the complete LoginForm.tsx code
# 4. Add to React MFE
# 5. Test authentication flow
```

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours for working login + profile

---

## 💡 Key Points to Remember

### What's Working Now
✅ Supabase client configured and accessible  
✅ Auth service ready (signup, login, OAuth)  
✅ Sentry capturing errors (dev mode logging)  
✅ PostHog tracking events and users  
✅ All dependencies bundled in shared library  
✅ Environment variables injected at build time  

### What's Next
🔜 Build authentication UI (login form, OAuth buttons)  
🔜 Test in production dashboards (Sentry/PostHog)  
🔜 Add error boundaries to React/Vue MFEs  
🔜 Implement user journey tracking  
🔜 Integrate remaining 3 services (Grafana, Resend, Cloudflare)  

### Known Limitations
⚠️ Angular MFE still has build issues (deferred)  
⚠️ Bundle size is 2.2MB (acceptable for internal tools)  
⚠️ Sentry/PostHog not yet tested in real dashboards  
⚠️ No UI components built yet (that's next phase)
