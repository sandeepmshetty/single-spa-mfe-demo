# üöÄ Quick Access Guide - Current Session

**Current Configuration**: Shell app is on **PORT 9000**

---

## ‚úÖ CORRECT URLs (Current Configuration)

### Main Application
```
http://localhost:9000
```

### All Routes
- **Home**: http://localhost:9000/
- **Users (React)**: http://localhost:9000/users
- **Products (Vue)**: http://localhost:9000/products
- **Dashboard (Angular)**: http://localhost:9000/dashboard

## üîç Zone.js Fix Applied

The zone.js import map has been updated in the shell app's `index.html`:

```javascript
"zone.js": "@empty"
```

This tells SystemJS to skip trying to load zone.js since it's already loaded globally via CDN.

---

## üéØ What to Do Now

### 1. Wait for Services to Start
All services are currently starting up via `npm run dev:all`:
- [0] Shared Library - Building...
- [1] React MFE - Port 3001
- [2] Vue MFE - Port 3002  
- [3] Angular MFE - Port 3003
- [4] Shell App - Port 9000

### 2. Check Browser
Once you see "Compiled successfully" messages for all services, open:

```
http://localhost:9000/dashboard
```

### 3. If Zone.js Error Persists

**Hard Refresh** the browser to clear cache:
- **Windows**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

---

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Success Signs
- ‚úÖ Shell app loads at http://localhost:9000
- ‚úÖ Navigation buttons visible (Home, Users, Products, Dashboard)
- ‚úÖ Clicking "Dashboard" loads Angular MFE
- ‚úÖ No zone.js errors in console

### If Angular Still Fails

The zone.js might need to be loaded differently. We can try:

**Option 1**: Make zone.js external in Angular webpack
**Option 2**: Use a different SystemJS configuration
**Option 3**: Bundle zone.js with Angular (larger bundle)

---

## üîÑ Current Status

**Services Starting**: Wait for all "Compiled successfully" messages  
**Port Configuration**: Shell app on 9000 (as shown in terminal)  
**Zone.js Fix**: Applied to import map  
**Next Step**: Test http://localhost:9000/dashboard after services finish starting

---

## ‚è∞ Estimated Wait Time

- Shared Library: ~5 seconds
- React MFE: ~3 seconds  
- Vue MFE: ~4 seconds
- Angular MFE: ~3 seconds
- Shell App: ~2 seconds

**Total**: ~15-20 seconds for all services to be ready

---

**Once you see all services compiled successfully, try accessing:**

```
http://localhost:9000/dashboard
```

If the zone.js error persists after hard refresh, let me know and we'll try a different approach!
